# This is CashCow

Invest!

CashCow allows you to search any company stock symbol (e.g. TSLA) and retrieve information about that stock from external APIs: the current share price, a graph showing the price change over the past 7 days, a recommendation to buy, sell or stick, information about the company, and a selection of links to current news articles related to the company.

You can also sign up to CashCow to upload and track the price of your own stock portfolio.
